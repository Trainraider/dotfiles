These are for Xubuntu now, not Linux Mint. Linux Mint was booting very slow for some reason.

I haven't tested the install script what-so-ever. I've simply added commands to it as I've used them to install things or configure things.

I use i3 with xfce. Xfwm and xfdesktop must be disabled for this to work. I do this in GUI so the install script does not do everything. I would like for it to do everything though...
